<body>
    <h1>There's a Button below for listing ALL programmers!</h1>
    <p>This kind of wild functionality would normally be hidden. Behind a log in system using sessions. Fairly easy to implement via PHP and other sources, but I ran out of time. As of writing this, its 21:26 Tuesday evening. No sleep tonight</p>
    <p> But! you know who can sleep? All the programmers this will list below!</p>
    <button id="buttGetAllProgrammers">This Button for every member of the programmer table</button>
